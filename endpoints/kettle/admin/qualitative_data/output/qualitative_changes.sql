This right means that every worker is entitled to a healthy and safe working environment. The promotion of wellbeing at work in all its aspects is primordial for protecting workers, for preserving their health and for ensuring they are motivated when doing their job.</li><li>The promotion of the wellbeing of workers offers added value to every individual company. Unhealthy and unsafe working conditions reduce productivity, which ultimately results in dismissals, closures and bankruptcies. Poor working conditions are also a form of unfair competition between businesses. And so, a lack of wellbeing at work is also a social-economic injustice.</li><li>Insufficient attention to wellbeing at work inevitably causes an increase in occupational health problems, which in turn has an impact on the expenditure of social security and social protection systems and so on the community as a whole. On the other hand, the promotion of wellbeing at work contributes to improving public health and the availability of workers in companies. As a result, the productivity and the competitiveness of companies is improved. This also has favourable consequences for the prosperity of our society as a whole.</li><li>A global approach to workers’ wellbeing does not end at the entrance to the plant: a healthy employee works better but vice versa healthy and safe working conditions will also improve overall health. As a result, several levels of authority are involved in the implementation of this global plan: the federal Minister for Employment, as well as the federal Minister of Social Affairs and Public Health, the Communities and the Regions. Consultation on various levels will thus be necessary, depending on the proposed actions.</li></ul>");

Improving well-being at work ultimately depends on the actions taken in the workplace. The first step in fulfilling the vision and reaching the objectives is that the workplaces meet the minimum requirements of legislation and get the basic conditions in order. The regional occupational safety and health administration is responsible for supervising that employers fulfil their <a href=\"https://julkaisut.valtioneuvosto.fi/handle/10024/161451\" target=\"_blank\">statutory obligations</a>.<br /><strong>Focus Area 1: Leadership, the corner stone of well-being at work </strong><br />“The quality of leadership in enterprises and other organisations will be improved together with interest groups and by influencing training and instruction. The conditions mentioned in the vision of these policies – health, safety and well-being – generally belong to a good leadership. Leadership will be developed with the object of creating a better safety climate. Improved leadership can be achieved mainly by cooperation and communication”.<br /><strong> Focus Area 2: Occupational health care, an efficient partner</strong></p><p>“The preventive role of occupational health care will be strengthened. The impact of occupational health care will be appraised on the basis of occupational health care reports and by monitoring sickness absence rates, occupational accidents and occupational diseases. To promote and support employees’ work ability, models of early support will be put into practice at workplaces. Cooperation between the line management and experts for promoting health and work ability will be improved. Cooperation includes mutual awareness and common forms of action (e.g. workplace surveys, risk assessment expertise and early support to employees and management) as part of improving health and safety. Successful cooperation with occupational health care requires a smooth flow of information and awareness of the state of affairs”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 3: Knowledge, will and competence through cooperation </strong><br />“A form of network cooperation for the work environment and well-being at work will be created for the different parties and actors, who all recognize their roles and tasks in the network. This occupational safety and health network operates in a result-oriented and efficient way for the work environment and well-being at work. It will be ascertained that the cooperation is functional both on the national and regional level and in workplaces as well”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 4: Effectiveness through communication </strong><br />“Together with interest groups it will be investigated what kind of communication best corresponds to the needs and brings good results in different contexts. Communication will be intensified by using various means and channels”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 5: Good legislation, the foundation for the minimum level of working conditions </strong><br />“Occupational safety and health legislation will be prepared in close cooperation with labour market parties so as to make legislation up-to-date and meet the needs of working life. The up-to-dateness of decrees will be evaluated at least every fifth year and that of acts at least every tenth year from the date of entry into force. In the EU politics, Finland will support the efforts for simplifying directives and transferring the focus to the member states when this is possible without reducing the basic regulation, such as that on risk assessment and cooperation at workplaces”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 6: Competent occupational safety and health administration ensures enforcement of legislation </strong>“By developing enforcement practices and personnel’s competence, the occupational safety and health administration ensures that enforcement is effective, competent and has a uniform quality. Evaluation of the impact of enforcement will be developed and the effects of the different actions monitored. Feedback from workplaces will be monitored by means of client questionnaires”.<br /><strong>Additional info from other programmes </strong><br />Other programs related to Health and Safety at Work<br />The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has set a goal to extend employees’ lifelong time at work by three years until the year 2020.

The main focus of the inspections is on sectors and occupational groups that are particularly frequently affected by MSDs. By 2017 some 16,000 companies will have been visited.<br />Customised training and seminars: Training courses for managers and multipliers enable specialists from the work programme to pass on their expertise in MSD prevention.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Specialist events, exhibitions and congresses:</span> Such events offer people responsible for OSH in companies an opportunity to talk to experts about MSDs. The MSD portal offers information on events currently planned.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Prevention culture and health skills:</span> The work programme focuses on two approaches for effectively reducing MSDs: the development of a prevention culture in companies – i.e. the design of optimised workplaces; and health skills – i.e. the promotion of appropriate behaviour on the part of employees. The work programme helps to ensure that</p><ul><li>More companies are equipped with ergonomically optimised workplaces, workstations and work procedures,</li><li>More companies operate a system of workplace health management,</li><li>Work organisation and management competence in companies are improved with a view to preventing MSDs,</li><li>More and improved risk assessments for physical and mental stress are carried out,</li><li>The number of preventive health checks is increased where there are high levels of strain on the musculoskeletal system.</li></ul><p>At the same time, more employees should benefit from company-supported MSD prevention measures in order to improve their health skills.<br /><strong>Work Programme \"Psyche\" </strong><br />Internet portal gda-psyche.de: Here employers and employees find can find relevant information on the subject of psychological strains at work. For example, under the heading \"Work and Psyche from A to Z\", it explains the various factors affecting the well-being of employees and what companies can change.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Recommendations for implementing psychosocial risk assessment:</span> Since the end of 2013 the Safety and Health at Work Act explicitly calls for the consideration of psychological stress in risk assessments. In seven steps, a new brochure (see box on the right) explains the risk assessment of psychological strain, its methods and tools. Parameters are described within which the actual implementation of risk assessment is to move. The brochure is aimed particularly at companies and occupational safety actors (e.g. employers, works and staff councils, company physicians and specialists for occupational safety).<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Practical tools for the workplace:</span> The work programme collects examples of good practice for dealing with psychological stress in the workplace and makes them known to the public. Companies, workers and occupational safety and health experts receive practical support for the improvement of working conditions in everyday business.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Qualification of inspectors:</span> Inspectors from occupational health and safety authorities and accident insurance institutions are trained to identify mental stress and to adequately advise companies. By the end of 2017, the entire inspection staff will have a basic knowledge about psychological stress.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Inspections and advice:</span> Since the beginning of 2015, the inspection staff of the occupational safety and health authorities and accident insurers conducts coordinated inspections. The focus of the site inspections is the consideration of psychological stress in the risk assessment. The inspectors also advise businesses specifically on setting up working hours so as to promote health and on dealing with traumatic events in the workplace.<br /><strong> Activity Collaboration of institutions </strong><br />The German strategy addresses with all its core elements the collaboration of institutions (work programmes, cooperation on inspection activities, development of a coherent set of rules).<br />Federal states and public accident insurance institutions hand in hand: the Joint German Occupational Safety and Health Strategy (GDA) provides the framework. As part of the GDA, state occupational safety and health authorities and public accident insurance institutions have undertaken to adopt a work-sharing and coordinated approach in advising and supervising companies.<br />This approach aims at coordination, standardisation and transparency in consultancy.<br />Key tools of the joint consultancy and supervisory strategy are:</p><ul><li>Framework agreements on the interaction of the state occupational safety and health authorities and the public accident insurance institutions</li><li>Joint guidelines for coordinated, tactical supervisory action and equivalent implementation of occupational safety and health regulations</li><li>Promotion of data and information exchange between the federal states and the public accident insurance institutions on company inspections.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, the \"Occupational Safety and Health Forum\" was established under the German Strategy. Its task is to ensure early and active participation of the expert representatives of the umbrella organisations of the employers and workers, the professional and industrial associations, science, the health and pension insurance funds, institutions in the sector of safety and health at work as well as bodies which help to promote employability in the development and updating of the Joint German OSH Strategy.<br /><strong> Activity Optimisation of rules and regulations</strong><br />Statutory regulations are the basis for implementing and evaluating occupational safety and health measures.<br />One important requirement for the effective implementation of occupational safety and health regulations is that they are practicable, consistent and, above all, easily manageable by the users and self-explanatory. The German government, federal states and public accident insurance institutions set themselves the task under the Joint German Occupational Safety and Health Strategy of optimising the rules and regulations relating to safety and health at work. One important module is the guideline paper on the restructuring of the set of rules and regulations in occupational safety and health passed in August 2011. The guideline paper defines the relationship of state law to autonomous law of the public accident insurance institutions and describes the procedures with which the two areas of law are harmonised.<br /><strong>Activity Improvement of the cooperation and coordination of the actions of the public occupational safety and health authorities and accident insurance funds </strong><br />The occupational safety and health authorities and accident insurance institutions have undertaken to adopt a work-sharing and coordinated approach in advising and supervising companies. This approach aims at coordination, standardisation and transparency in consultancy. Activities are carried out accordingly to a <a href=\": http://www.gda-portal.de/en/SupportCompanies/SupportCompanies.html\" target=\"_blank\">programmatic approach</a>:<br />Key tools of the joint consultancy and supervisory strategy are:</p><ul><li>Framework agreements on the interaction of the state occupational safety and health authorities and the public accident insurance institutions</li><li>Joint guidelines for coordinated, tactical supervisory action and equivalent implementation of occupational safety and health regulations</li><li>Promotion of data and information exchange between the federal states and the public accident insurance institutions on company inspections</li></ul>");

<p>Public information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Level of awareness of inhabitants regarding labour protection issues should be assessed as non-sufficient in general.</li>
    <li>The main risk groups include young people with a low level of education, as well as inhabitants who work in micro and small-sized enterprises.</li>
    <li>Lack of auxiliary materials for training and instructing of employees, non-sufficient understanding and performance of requirements of laws and regulations, lack of knowledge and unwillingness to obtain additional information, to learn and comply with the requirements, are possible causes of the low level of awareness of persons employed in small-sized and micro enterprises.</li>
</ul>
<p>Promoting efficient introduction of the labour protection requirements:</p>
<ol>
    <li>A high number of accidents, especially a large proportion in hazardous sectors, due to an unsafe work environment in enterprises, related to a non-sufficient practical implemen-tation of labour protection requirements in the enterprises.</li>
    <li>Especially high number of serious and fatal accidents, which in Latvia is higher than on average in the EU.</li>
    <li>Risk groups:<ul>
            <li>Small-sized and micro enterprises are a special risk group.</li>
            <li>Work places in the enterprises of manufacturing industry, transport and storage sector, construction, agricultural and forestry, as well as fishery, manufacturing of paper and paper products, printing and publishing, manufacturing of textile products and garments, manufacturing of metal and metal products.</li>
            <li>Enterprises of the private sector, enterprises where non-registered employment exists, i.e., where at least a part of the salary is paid in an envelope, as well as enterprises, which have been recently established.</li>
            <li>Enterprises which are located in Riga and Zemgale Region.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Promoting health protection of employed persons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The large number of persons suffering from occupational diseases, occupational and work-related diseases, as well as development of occupational diseases among comparatively young people.</li>
    <li>Late diagnostics of occupational diseases when health disorders are progressing and cannot be prevented, but require a long-term medical treatment and cause significant expenditure for both the victim of an occupational disease himself or herself and the employer, and the public in general.</li>
    <li>Unhealthy and sedentary lifestyle.</li>
    <li>Changes in the structure of the most widespread occupational diseases, during the last years by the most rapid increase in the number of occupational diseases caused by physical overload.</li>
    <li>Ergonomic risk factors &mdash; repeated movements or body positions causing pain and lifting, carrying or moving of loads on an everyday basis.</li>
    <li>Stress is mentioned as the work environment risk encountered most often in Latvia.</li>
</ol>
<p>Supervision and control of the field of the labour protection:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Necessity to obtain wider, deepened information regarding situation in enterprises, compliance with labour protection requirements and current labour protection issues.</li>
    <li>Non-sufficient knowledge and skills of SLI officials for preventive and deepened inspection of hazardous sectors, which is determined by the fast technological development and high turnover of SLI officials.</li>
    <li>Non-competitive remuneration, which hinders filling of vacant posts of inspectors with employees, who are competent and compliant with the requirements.</li>
    <li>Non-sufficiency of technological provision at the disposal of the SLI and depreciation of the present technologies, thus non-conformity with practical needs, as well as lack of IS application of the SLI for remote work. By working with depreciated office equipment and devices, provision of services for clients is burdened, work efficiency is reduced and costs for repair of devices are increased.</li>
    <li>Further training of inspectors, by attracting qualified lecturers, is required; the necessity to introduce new working methods in practice and pay more attention to preventive work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ensuring safe work environment within the framework of non-standard forms of employment, as well as in the work of self-employed persons:</p>
<ol>
    <li>There is greater insecurity in respect to safety and health at work in non-standard forms of employment.</li>
    <li>Low awareness of self-employed persons and interest in labour protection issues.</li>
    <li>Lack of first aid kits and other aid in work of self-employed persons, because they are not purchased at all, their purchase is delayed or their due maintenance is not carried out.</li>
    <li>Problems with improvement of accommodation conditions at workplaces of self-employed persons, for example, construction or repair of showers, rest rooms, toilets and purchase of work clothes and personal protective equipment.</li>
    <li>Self-employed persons by failing to pay sufficient attention to their safety and health protection at work, do not pay sufficient attention to ensuring of rest time either.</li>
    <li>Concurrently, specific information regarding labour protection issues at work of self-employed persons is not compiled and is not easy accessible.</li>

That requires a sufficient quantity and quality of labour inspectors and other employees of bodies supervising OSHP. Language skills, English in particular, are also necessary<br />The performance of labour inspections and state supervision over OSHP must be intensified and its quality must be improved to the level of standards achieved in the EU Member States<br />The effective use of existing financial, technical and personnel resources of the state inspection bodies and supervisory organs should be achieved by better coordination and the gradual creation of conditions for the suitable institutional integration of present inspection and supervisory organs. <br /><strong>Priority 3: Improving the quality of activities of specialized subjects eligible to perform activities in the area of OSHP </strong><br />According to legal requirements, small and medium-sized organizations which do not have their own experts in the area of OSHP are obliged to fulfil certain obligations in the area of OSHP; these tasks are frequently ensured through outsourced/supply companies which are authorized to perform activities related to preventative and protective services (safety technical service, occupational health service). <br />As a result, labour inspectorates and public health authorities must intensively verify the quality of services and carry out controls in these companies focused on the professional qualifications of their employees and the quality and professional standards of their methods. <br /><strong> Priority 4: Applying system approach to OSHP-related issues </strong><br />Fulfilling the obligations in the area of OSHP is often insufficient, especially among small and medium-size employers and the level of legal awareness is low. It has been demonstrated that the application of a system approach to OSHP and its verification by an independent third party will increase the level of OSHP among individual subjects. In addition to the OSHP management system pursuant to the OHSAS 18 001 standard, the level of protection of employees in organizations in Slovakia can be verified through the Safe Enterprise project implemented by the National Labour Inspectorate (hereinafter referred to as the “NLI”). <br /><strong>Priority 5: The Focus of attention on sectors with a high number of occupational accidents and diseases </strong><br />Prevention, monitoring, punitive and repressive activities of the labour inspection and other state OSH institutions will focus on sectors and jobs with a higher incidence of health damage.</p>");

There needs to be much broader ownership of the issues. This means engaging everyone who shares the responsibility for helping Great Britain work well, because they have a vital role in managing risk and preventing damage to individuals, businesses and the economy. <br />Across each nation, region or sector, we need collective ownership that best reflects local circumstances. The regulators will retain their key roles, providing targeted advice and guidance for key audience groups and taking enforcement action when and where necessary. Encouraging others to take ownership of health and safety will be critical in making this theme successful. This means everyone collaborating to reach those who may have been less engaged”. <br /><strong>Strategic theme 2: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/tackling-ill-health.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tackling ill health</a>: Highlighting and tackling the costs of work-related ill health </strong> <br />Quote: <br />“Work-related ill health is a problem for every section of society, with conditions ranging from cancer and other long-latency diseases, to stress and musculo-skeletal disorders. Greater awareness of the harm, costs and preventability of work-related ill health should drive collective action to improve health outcomes. <br />This will require long-term and coordinated action across all sectors, bringing in additional partners such as the NHS and others to support the substantial behaviour change and awareness programmes that will be required. A key element of this theme will be in earlier prevention, which is more cost-effective than trying to intervene when a person is suffering from more serious ill health. This will involve a greater focus on health issues at work, while continuing to ensure that maintaining standards around safety remains a priority”. <br /><strong> Strategic theme 3: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/managing-risk-well.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Managing risk well</a>: Simplifying risk management and helping business to grow </strong><br />Quote:<br />“Successful organisations understand that sensible and proportionate risk management is integral to delivering their business. This approach supports growth, enables innovation and protects an organisation’s most vital asset, its people. Positive outcomes can include reduced sickness absence, lower costs and a good reputation. Promoting this compelling business case should help even more businesses to make the most of the many benefits a good health and safety culture can bring. Sharing examples of practice, supported by targeted, relevant advice and information will allow the system to set a common understanding of what proportionate health and safety looks like. Health and safety professionals have an important role to play. Helping businesses of all sizes get it right in an efficient and effective way will build trust and improve standards”. <br /><strong> Strategic theme 4: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/supporting-small-employers.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Supporting small employers:</a> Giving SMEs simple advice so they know what they have to do </strong><br />Quote:<br />Reaching micro and small businesses can be difficult, but not impossible. Working together, much has already been done to help small businesses, but there are opportunities to work smarter. Already many large businesses and intermediaries have developed efficient supply chains and productive relationships by working with and supporting small businesses. Many organisations also provide free help and support to SMEs outside their supply chains through cross-sector initiatives. <br />For SMEs, managing workplace risks shouldn’t be complicated or costly. Making support available which is quick and easy for small businesses to understand, so that they can fulfil their obligations, remains a challenge for all sectors. It will also be important to identify who the key influencers are for SMEs, working with them to raise awareness levels about the peer and expert support that is out there”. <br /><strong> Strategic theme 5: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/keeping-pace-with-change.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Keeping pace with change</a>: Anticipating and tackling new health and safety challenges </strong><br />Quote: <br />“Great Britain leads the world in anticipating and tackling the new health and safety challenges that come with social, economic and technological change. <br />This ability to horizon scan, when combined with the deep knowledge and unrivalled expertise of the system, means that anticipating new health and safety challenges is an area where Great Britain can play a leading role, for example through HSE’s world-leading research capabilities. They are already being put to use helping Great Britain, as well as countries around the world, to improve health and safety, as well as better business outcomes. <br />To remain a world leader in risk management, Great Britain needs to develop high-quality capability, anticipating the workplace challenges of tomorrow and using the flexibility of our goal-setting approach to solve them in ways that enable innovation and the use of new technologies. <br />Tackling the problems of tomorrow today is a responsible investment that protects workers, enables new and different approaches and provides the new knowledge, skills and expertise Great Britain can share internationally.” <br /><strong> Strategic theme 6: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/sharing-our-success.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Sharing our success</a>: Promoting the benefits of Great Britain’s world-class health and safety system </strong><br />Quote: <br />“Everyone can take pride in Great Britain’s world-class reputation for health and safety and promote its success at home and abroad. Creating a world-class system is a goal we can all unite around and benefit from as a source of inspiration and achievement, and can also be pleased to support. <br />This strategy has largely concerned itself with improving standards in Great Britain. But we should also look to share best practice and the latest thinking and innovation around the world. This can help influence health and safety systems overseas and make it easier for British businesses to expand into new markets and territories. The work can also bring commercial opportunities for selling British health and safety ‘products’ or consultancy.</p>");

It aims to provide up-to-date online information for all interested parties and stakeholders about the status of OSH in the European Union.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overall objective of this activity is to design and develop a reliable and stable information system on OSH in Europe, based on data from the relevant national and European data providers. From 2016 to 2018, two contractors of DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion (Kooperationsstelle Hamburg IFE and Eurogip) developed the structure of the system, collected data for a selected number of indicators and assessed their reliability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EU-OSHA will contribute to the establishment and maintenance of the <strong>OSH BAROMETER</strong> by designing and running the data visualisation tool, ensuring data quality in cooperation with key data providers and stakeholders, and feeding in the quantitative and qualitative data in close collaboration with EU institutions and Member State Contact Points. As part of its activity <strong>‘EU OSH INFO System’</strong>, EU-OSHA will publish an analytical report, based on the collected data, every 3 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>OSH BAROMETER&nbsp;</strong>uses the following data sources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Eurostat: data on economy, sectors, population, and employment</li>
  <li>Eurostat: Labour Force Survey (LFS), particularly the ad hoc module from 2013: ‘Accidents at work and other work-related health problems’</li>
  <li>Eurostat: European Union Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC)</li>
  <li>Eurofound: European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS)</li>
  <li>EU-OSHA: European Survey of Enterprises’ New and Emerging Risks (ESENER) 2014</li>
  <li>European Commission, DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion: several reports and studies</li>
  <li>Senior Labour Inspectors Committee (SLIC): non-confidential country evaluations</li>
  <li>National contact points in Member States: national data and descriptions</li>
  <li>EU-OSHA focal points/EU-OSHA: descriptions of the national OSH Systems in OSHwiki</li>
  <li>comprehensive reports from national or European sources</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This methodology contains a compilation of all references and data sources that were used to provide texts, diagrams and tables, and in some cases additional explanations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In most cases we provide the following data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the indicator and diagram/table/description title</li>
  <li>a short description of the data evaluation and visualisation approach</li>
  <li>exact source with name and link</li>
  <li>the period of reference (year/period) and the last update</li>
  <li>the coverage of Member States and other countries</li>
  <li>filter options or selection criteria of the source</li>
  <li>the measuring unit</li>
  <li>any calculation that EU-OSHA performed based on the original data</li>
  <li>visualisation basics</li>
  <li>other useful explanations and additional comments</li>
</ul>");

Contribution rates depend on the size of the establishment, its sector of activity, and the frequency and seriousness of the accidents or diseases from which its employees may suffer. The compensation mission consists of meeting the needs of the victims by bearing the costs incurred by victims of occupational accidents and diseases, by reimbursing treatment expenses, and by paying daily allowances and pensions, annuities or lump sums in the event of permanent disability.<br />The CNAMTS is an administrative national public establishment overseen by the Social Security Directorate. Its responsibilities and missions are specified in particular by French Law No 2004-810 of 13 August 2004. The activities of the CNAMTS consist, in particular, of the following:</p><ul><li>Defining the focuses, principles and objectives that guide CNAMTS’ action and the action of the French National Health Insurance Scheme for salaried workers (the general social security scheme, or Assurance Maladie), and ensuring that they are implemented.</li><li>Defining and promoting the prevention of diseases, and occupational accidents and diseases by taking effective national action.</li><li>Determining and coordinating the activities of the bodies of the network of health insurance branches and occupational accidents and diseases branches: regional and local health insurance funds (caisses primaires d'assurance maladie), Occupational Health and Pension Insurance Funds (Caisses d’Assurance Retraite et de la Santé au Travail), the regional health insurance fund of the Paris region (Caisse Régionale d’Assurance Maladie d’Île de France), and the general social security funds for French overseas territories (Caisses Générales de la Sécurité Sociale). These local and regional health insurance funds particularly have the mission of assisting companies in assessing the risks of occupational accidents and diseases, with a view to preventing those risks, and the mission of helping to price insurance for occupational accidents and diseases. They advise companies on their risk prevention approach through direct action in the workplace. They also act through collective actions with various trade sectors, designing risk assessment and risk prevention systems, offering training, disseminating good practices and distributing financial incentives.</li></ul><p>The Occupational Accidents and Diseases Commission (Commission des Accidents du Travail et des Maladies Professionnelles) is in charge of balancing the finances of the Occupational Accidents and Diseases (AT/MP) Branch with regard to pricing, compensation, and the prevention of occupational accidents and diseases. Given this, it determines the focuses of the Agreement on Objectives and Management (COG — Convention d’Objectifs et de Gestion) for the branch. It also approves the budgets for the French National Fund for the Prevention of Occupational Accidents and Diseases (Fonds National de Prévention des Accidents du Travail et des Maladies Professionnelles).</p>");

  <br>MATEPSS is established as an association of private companies supervised by the MITRAMISS.. MATEPSS is obliged to cooperate with the authorities in charge of the public social security system. Companies can choose to join MATEPSS; otherwise, worker compensation is guaranteed by the public insurance institute INSS. Companies in some sectors, such as mining, fishing and agriculture, are excluded from joining MATEPSS . In these cases also the public system guarantees worker compensation. In Approximately 1.5 million companies are members of MATEPSS, representing ca. 13.5 million workers (2015)

In practice, most insurers offer cover of at least GBP 10 million. When a policy is taken out or renewed, the insurer provides a certificate of employers’ liability insurance. This must clearly state the minimum level of cover provided and the companies covered by the policy. The employer must display a copy of the certificate of insurance where their employees can easily read it.<br />The HSE enforces the law on employers’ liability insurance, and HSE inspectors can check that an employer has employers’ liability insurance with an approved insurer for at least GBP 5 million. The inspectors may also ask to see the certificate of insurance and other insurance details. If an employer does not have suitable insurance, they can be fined up to GBP 2,500 for any day that they are without insurance.

<p>LABOUR MARKET RESEARCH INSTITUTE (till 1st of December, 2014 - Institute of Labour and Social Research) is the unit of public research institute - the Lithuanian Social Research Centre (LSRC). The Institute was founded in 1991 (it’s founder - the Ministry of Social Security and labour of the Republic of Lithuania) and by 2009 December 31 acted as a separate legal entity - a scientific research institute that provides the public benefit of research services in the field of social protection and labour market policies.</p>
<p>Under the Government of the Republic of Lithuania 23 December 2009 resolution No 1796 “Due to reorganization of Social Research Institute and Institute of Labour and Social Research” from 1 January 2010 all Labour Market Research Institute rights and responsibilities took over LSRC.</p>

Today, while continuing to support the HSE, the HSL now works with a wide range of other public and private sector organisations, often conducting detailed and bespoke research and development work on their behalf. The HSL’s primary role is to provide investigative work and services arising from HSE’s day-to-day operations, which often require a rapid multidisciplinary response. The HSE maintains a dedicated horizon-scanning team, based at the HSL, to keep the health and safety consequences arising from new trends in science and technology under review.

Supervision is exercised by different inspection activities, the main ones being general, target or follow-up inspection.

The main focus is on the assessment of work environment situation of the enterprise and the employer’s activity in organising the work environment.</p><p>The aim of the inspection is to ensure safer working conditions, obtain information on the compliance of enterprises with legal acts, and resulting from the assessment, the working environment situation as a whole in the Republic is analysed.</p><p>In the course of a target inspection visit, compliance with the requirements of specific legal acts is monitored. A more specific sector is focused in the case of an enterprise with one or different fields of activity. A target inspection visit can also be motivated by information submitted to the Labour Inspectorate on non-compliance with occupational health and safety requirements, diagnosing work-related diseases, occurrence of an accident at work or hazardous work. In the course of a follow-up inspection, elimination of earlier detected infringements is monitored at the enterprise. In the course of inspection of a new or reconstructed building, the conformity of work environment with the requirements of health and safety at work is monitored. Such inspections are carried out at the request of a local government and in cases when the employer has notified the Labour Inspectorate of the commencement of activities or change of the field of activity. One of the responsibilities of the Labour Inspectorate is to carry out market supervision of personal protective equipment to be supplied. During the inspection, the compliance of personal protective equipment with requirements is checked with the aim of preventing placing on the market and taking into use of unsuitable personal protective equipment. The Occupational Health and Safety Act provides labour inspectors with several rights for carrying out supervision, including the right to enter the work place to be inspected with the aim of performing inspection activity (if necessary, also unannounced), receive information necessary for inspection, examine relevant documents, receive copies of them free of charge or have them made on the spot, and in the case of suspicion of misdemeanour, take along documents, require audit measurements of the working environment, take pictures and samples of materials and substances to be analysed, interview the employer, work environment representative, work environment specialist and workers alone or in the presence of witnesses and issue a notice with the purpose of terminating the infringement of requirements of legal acts and eliminating the consequences of the infringements.</p><p>The Labour Inspectorate together with other state authorities – Health Board, National Institute for Health Development, Rescue Board, Consumer Protection Inspectorate, Technical Regulatory Authority, Road Administration, Tax and Customs Board – form a national structure protecting good health of the population of Estonia.

The Labour Inspectorate cooperates with Rescue Board, Consumer Protection Inspectorate, Technical Regulatory Authority, Road Administration and Tax and Customs Board mainly within the framework of ensuring healthy and safe work environment and supervision of labour relations.</p>");
