The promotion of wellbeing at work in all its aspects is primordial for protecting workers, for preserving their health and for ensuring they are motivated when doing their job. </li><li>The promotion of the wellbeing of workers offers added value to every individual company. Unhealthy and unsafe working conditions reduce productivity, which ultimately results in dismissals, closures and bankruptcies. Poor working conditions are also a form of unfair competition between businesses. And so, a lack of wellbeing at work is also a social-economic injustice.</li><li> Insufficient attention to wellbeing at work inevitably causes an increase in occupational health problems, which in turn has an impact on the expenditure of social security and social protection systems and so on the community as a whole. On the other hand, the promotion of wellbeing at work contributes to improving public health and the availability of workers in companies. As a result, the productivity and the competitiveness of companies is improved. This also has favourable consequences for the prosperity of our society as a whole.</li><li>A global approach to workers’ wellbeing does not end at the entrance to the plant: a healthy employee works better but vice versa healthy and safe working conditions will also improve overall health. As a result, several levels of authority are involved in the implementation of this global plan: the federal Minister for Employment, as well as the federal Minister of Social Affairs and Public Health, the Communities and the Regions.

The analysis was conducted from July 2015 to autumn 2016.<br/>The overall result of the analysis showed no basis to modify the existing principle for selection of enterprises for risk-based inspection.

Improving well-being at work ultimately depends on the actions taken in the workplace. The first step in fulfilling the vision and reaching the objectives is that the workplaces meet the minimum requirements of legislation and get the basic conditions in order. The regional occupational safety and health administration is responsible for supervising that employers fulfil their statutory obligations.<br/><strong>Focus Area 1: Leadership, the corner stone of well-being at work </strong><br/>“The quality of leadership in enterprises and other organisations will be improved together with interest groups and by influencing training and instruction. The conditions mentioned in the vision of these policies – health, safety and well-being – generally belong to a good leadership. Leadership will be developed with the object of creating a better safety climate. Improved leadership can be achieved mainly by cooperation and communication”.<br/><strong> Focus Area 2: Occupational health care, an efficient partner</strong>“The preventive role of occupational health care will be strengthened. The impact of occupational health care will be appraised on the basis of occupational health care reports and by monitoring sickness absence rates, occupational accidents and occupational diseases. To promote and support employees’ work ability, models of early support will be put into practice at workplaces. Cooperation between the line management and experts for promoting health and work ability will be improved. Cooperation includes mutual awareness and common forms of action (e.g. workplace surveys, risk assessment expertise and early support to employees and management) as part of improving health and safety. Successful cooperation with occupational health care requires a smooth flow of information and awareness of the state of affairs”.<br/><strong>Focus Area 3: Knowledge, will and competence through cooperation </strong><br/>“A form of network cooperation for the work environment and well-being at work will be created for the different parties and actors, who all recognize their roles and tasks in the network. This occupational safety and health network operates in a result-oriented and efficient way for the work environment and well-being at work. It will be ascertained that the cooperation is functional both on the national and regional level and in workplaces as well”.<br/><strong>Focus Area 4: Effectiveness through communication </strong><br/>“Together with interest groups it will be investigated what kind of communication best corresponds to the needs and brings good results in different contexts. Communication will be intensified by using various means and channels”.<br/><strong>Focus Area 5: Good legislation, the foundation for the minimum level of working conditions </strong><br/>“Occupational safety and health legislation will be prepared in close cooperation with labour market parties so as to make legislation up-to-date and meet the needs of working life. The up-to-dateness of decrees will be evaluated at least every fifth year and that of acts at least every tenth year from the date of entry into force. In the EU politics, Finland will support the efforts for simplifying directives and transferring the focus to the member states when this is possible without reducing the basic regulation, such as that on risk assessment and cooperation at workplaces”.<br/><strong>Focus Area 6: Competent occupational safety and health administration ensures enforcement of legislation </strong>“By developing enforcement practices and personnel’s competence, the occupational safety and health administration ensures that enforcement is effective, competent and has a uniform quality.

In seven steps, a new brochure (see box on the right) explains the risk assessment of psychological strain, its methods and tools. Parameters are described within which the actual implementation of risk assessment is to move. The brochure is aimed particularly at companies and occupational safety actors (e.g. employers, works and staff councils, company physicians and specialists for occupational safety).<br/>Practical tools for the workplace: The work programme collects examples of good practice for dealing with psychological stress in the workplace and makes them known to the public. Companies, workers and occupational safety and health experts receive practical support for the improvement of working conditions in everyday business.<br/>Qualification of inspectors: Inspectors from occupational health and safety authorities and accident insurance institutions are trained to identify mental stress and to adequately advise companies. By the end of 2017, the entire inspection staff will have a basic knowledge about psychological stress.<br/>Inspections and advice: Since the beginning of 2015, the inspection staff of the occupational safety and health authorities and accident insurers conducts coordinated inspections. The focus of the site inspections is the consideration of psychological stress in the risk assessment. The inspectors also advise businesses specifically on setting up working hours so as to promote health and on dealing with traumatic events in the workplace.<br/><strong> Activity Collaboration of institutions </strong><br/>The German strategy addresses with all its core elements the collaboration of institutions (work programmes, cooperation on inspection activities, development of a coherent set of rules).<br/>Federal states and public accident insurance institutions hand in hand: the Joint German Occupational Safety and Health Strategy (GDA) provides the framework. As part of the GDA, state occupational safety and health authorities and public accident insurance institutions have undertaken to adopt a work-sharing and coordinated approach in advising and supervising companies.<br/>This approach aims at coordination, standardisation and transparency in consultancy.<br/>Key tools of the joint consultancy and supervisory strategy are: <ul><li>Framework agreements on the interaction of the state occupational safety and health authorities and the public accident insurance institutions </li><li>Joint guidelines for coordinated, tactical supervisory action and equivalent implementation of occupational safety and health regulations </li><li>Promotion of data and information exchange between the federal states and the public accident insurance institutions on company inspections.</li></ul>Furthermore, the „Occupational Safety and Health Forum“ was established under the German Strategy. Its task is to ensure early and active participation of the expert representatives of the umbrella organisations of the employers and workers, the professional and industrial associations, science, the health and pension insurance funds, institutions in the sector of safety and health at work as well as bodies which help to promote employability in the development and updating of the Joint German OSH Strategy.<br/><strong> Activity Optimisation of rules and regulations</strong><br/>Statutory regulations are the basis for implementing and evaluating occupational safety and health measures.<br/>One important requirement for the effective implementation of occupational safety and health regulations is that they are practicable, consistent and, above all, easily manageable by the users and self-explanatory. The German government, federal states and public accident insurance institutions set themselves the task under the Joint German Occupational Safety and Health Strategy of optimising the rules and regulations relating to safety and health at work. One important module is the guideline paper on the restructuring of the set of rules and regulations in occupational safety and health passed in August 2011.

That requires a sufficient quantity and quality of labour inspectors and other employees of bodies supervising OSHP.

It has been demonstrated that the application of a system approach to OSHP and its verification by an independent third party will increase the level of OSHP among individual subjects.

	(241, '<strong> Strategic theme 1: Acting together: Promoting broader ownership of health and safety in Great Britain </strong> <br/>Quote: <br/>“Health and safety should not be a responsibility assigned to a particular individual or part of an organisation, but an integral part of everyone’s role. There needs to be much broader ownership of the issues. This means engaging everyone who shares the responsibility for helping Great Britain work well, because they have a vital role in managing risk and preventing damage to individuals, businesses and the economy. <br/>Across each nation, region or sector, we need collective ownership that best reflects local circumstances. The regulators will retain their key roles, providing targeted advice and guidance for key audience groups and taking enforcement action when and where necessary. Encouraging others to take ownership of health and safety will be critical in making this theme successful. This means everyone collaborating to reach those who may have been less engaged”. <br/><strong>Strategic theme 2: Tackling ill health: Highlighting and tackling the costs of work-related ill health </strong> <br/>Quote: <br/>“Work-related ill health is a problem for every section of society, with conditions ranging from cancer and other long-latency diseases, to stress and musculo-skeletal disorders. Greater awareness of the harm, costs and preventability of work-related ill health should drive collective action to improve health outcomes. <br/>This will require long-term and coordinated action across all sectors, bringing in additional partners such as the NHS and others to support the substantial behaviour change and awareness programmes that will be required. A key element of this theme will be in earlier prevention, which is more cost-effective than trying to intervene when a person is suffering from more serious ill health. This will involve a greater focus on health issues at work, while continuing to ensure that maintaining standards around safety remains a priority”. <br/><strong> Strategic theme 3:Managing risk well: Simplifying risk management and helping business to grow </strong><br/>Quote<br/>“Successful organisations understand that sensible and proportionate risk management is integral to delivering their business. This approach supports growth, enables innovation and protects an organisation’s most vital asset, its people. Positive outcomes can include reduced sickness absence, lower costs and a good reputation. Promoting this compelling business case should help even more businesses to make the most of the many benefits a good health and safety culture can bring. Sharing examples of practice, supported by targeted, relevant advice and information will allow the system to set a common understanding of what proportionate health and safety looks like. Health and safety professionals have an important role to play. Helping businesses of all sizes get it right in an efficient and effective way will build trust and improve standards”. <br/><strong> Strategic theme 4: Supporting small employers: Giving SMEs simple advice so they know what they have to do </strong><br/>Quote<br/>Reaching micro and small businesses can be difficult, but not impossible. Working together, much has already been done to help small businesses, but there are opportunities to work smarter. Already many large businesses and intermediaries have developed efficient supply chains and productive relationships by working with and supporting small businesses. Many organisations also provide free help and support to SMEs outside their supply chains through cross-sector initiatives. <br/>For SMEs, managing workplace risks shouldn’t be complicated or costly. Making support available which is quick and easy for small businesses to understand, so that they can fulfil their obligations, remains a challenge for all sectors. It will also be important to identify who the key influencers are for SMEs, working with them to raise awareness levels about the peer and expert support that is out there”. <br/><strong> Strategic theme 5:Keeping pace with change: Anticipating and tackling new health and safety challenges </strong><br/>Quote: <br/>“Great Britain leads the world in anticipating and tackling the new health and safety challenges that come with social, economic and technological change. <br/>This ability to horizon scan, when combined with the deep knowledge and unrivalled expertise of the system, means that anticipating new health and safety challenges is an area where Great Britain can play a leading role, for example through HSE’s world-leading research capabilities. They are already being put to use helping Great Britain, as well as countries around the world, to improve health and safety, as well as better business outcomes. <br/>To remain a world leader in risk management, Great Britain needs to develop high-quality capability, anticipating the workplace challenges of tomorrow and using the flexibility of our goal-setting approach to solve them in ways that enable innovation and the use of new technologies. <br/>Tackling the problems of tomorrow today is a responsible investment that protects workers, enables new and different approaches and provides the new knowledge, skills and expertise Great Britain can share internationally.” <br/><strong> Strategic theme 6:Sharing our success: Promoting the benefits of Great Britain’s world-class health and safety system </strong><br/>Quote: <br/>“Everyone can take pride in Great Britain’s world-class reputation for health and safety and promote its success at home and abroad. Creating a world-class system is a goal we can all unite around and benefit from as a source of inspiration and achievement, and can also be pleased to support. <br/>This strategy has largely concerned itself with improving standards in Great Britain. But we should also look to share best practice and the latest thinking and innovation around the world.
