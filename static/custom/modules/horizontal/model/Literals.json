  "L20079":"<p>Main reasons for the strategy:<br />Quote:</p><ul><li>The right to work is a human right. This right means that every worker is entitled to a healthy and safe working environment. The promotion of wellbeing at work in all its aspects is primordial for protecting workers, for preserving their health and for ensuring they are motivated when doing their job.</li><li>The promotion of the wellbeing of workers offers added value to every individual company. Unhealthy and unsafe working conditions reduce productivity, which ultimately results in dismissals, closures and bankruptcies. Poor working conditions are also a form of unfair competition between businesses. And so, a lack of wellbeing at work is also a social-economic injustice.</li><li>Insufficient attention to wellbeing at work inevitably causes an increase in occupational health problems, which in turn has an impact on the expenditure of social security and social protection systems and so on the community as a whole. On the other hand, the promotion of wellbeing at work contributes to improving public health and the availability of workers in companies. As a result, the productivity and the competitiveness of companies is improved. This also has favourable consequences for the prosperity of our society as a whole.</li><li>A global approach to workers’ wellbeing does not end at the entrance to the plant: a healthy employee works better but vice versa healthy and safe working conditions will also improve overall health. As a result, several levels of authority are involved in the implementation of this global plan: the federal Minister for Employment, as well as the federal Minister of Social Affairs and Public Health, the Communities and the Regions. Consultation on various levels will thus be necessary, depending on the proposed actions.</li></ul>",

  "L20121":"<p>The strategy defines the objectives, focal areas and principles of developing the activity in the next few years.<br />Six focal areas or actions of occupational safety and health have been formed:</p><ol><li>Maintenance and promotion of work ability and functional capacity</li><li>Prevention of occupational accidents and diseases</li><li>Prevention of musculoskeletal disorders</li><li>Mental well-being at work</li><li>Coping at work</li><li>Job control</li></ol><p>Creating good work environments and well-being presupposes that people in the workplaces have adequate and proper knowledge, will and competence needed for reaching the goals. Improving well-being at work ultimately depends on the actions taken in the workplace. The first step in fulfilling the vision and reaching the objectives is that the workplaces meet the minimum requirements of legislation and get the basic conditions in order. The regional occupational safety and health administration is responsible for supervising that employers fulfil their <a href=\"http://www.julkari.fi/handle/10024/112065\" target=\"_blank\">statutory obligations</a>.<br /><strong>Focus Area 1: Leadership, the corner stone of well-being at work </strong><br />“The quality of leadership in enterprises and other organisations will be improved together with interest groups and by influencing training and instruction. The conditions mentioned in the vision of these policies – health, safety and well-being – generally belong to a good leadership. Leadership will be developed with the object of creating a better safety climate. Improved leadership can be achieved mainly by cooperation and communication”.<br /><strong> Focus Area 2: Occupational health care, an efficient partner</strong></p><p>“The preventive role of occupational health care will be strengthened. The impact of occupational health care will be appraised on the basis of occupational health care reports and by monitoring sickness absence rates, occupational accidents and occupational diseases. To promote and support employees’ work ability, models of early support will be put into practice at workplaces. Cooperation between the line management and experts for promoting health and work ability will be improved. Cooperation includes mutual awareness and common forms of action (e.g. workplace surveys, risk assessment expertise and early support to employees and management) as part of improving health and safety. Successful cooperation with occupational health care requires a smooth flow of information and awareness of the state of affairs”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 3: Knowledge, will and competence through cooperation </strong><br />“A form of network cooperation for the work environment and well-being at work will be created for the different parties and actors, who all recognize their roles and tasks in the network. This occupational safety and health network operates in a result-oriented and efficient way for the work environment and well-being at work. It will be ascertained that the cooperation is functional both on the national and regional level and in workplaces as well”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 4: Effectiveness through communication </strong><br />“Together with interest groups it will be investigated what kind of communication best corresponds to the needs and brings good results in different contexts. Communication will be intensified by using various means and channels”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 5: Good legislation, the foundation for the minimum level of working conditions </strong><br />“Occupational safety and health legislation will be prepared in close cooperation with labour market parties so as to make legislation up-to-date and meet the needs of working life. The up-to-dateness of decrees will be evaluated at least every fifth year and that of acts at least every tenth year from the date of entry into force. In the EU politics, Finland will support the efforts for simplifying directives and transferring the focus to the member states when this is possible without reducing the basic regulation, such as that on risk assessment and cooperation at workplaces”.<br /><strong>Focus Area 6: Competent occupational safety and health administration ensures enforcement of legislation </strong>“By developing enforcement practices and personnel’s competence, the occupational safety and health administration ensures that enforcement is effective, competent and has a uniform quality. Evaluation of the impact of enforcement will be developed and the effects of the different actions monitored. Feedback from workplaces will be monitored by means of client questionnaires”.<br /><strong>Additional info from other programmes </strong><br />Other programs related to Health and Safety at Work<br />The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health has set a goal to extend employees’ lifelong time at work by three years until the year 2020.

The audits are based on the GDA guidelines on OSH organisation and the GDA guidelines on risk assessment and documentation.<br />Information events and seminars on workplace OSH organisation.<br />Services for introducing an OSH management system, for example as part of an inspection and consulting process.</p><p><strong>Work Programme \"Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs)\"</strong></p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Information:</span> A <a href=\"www.gdabewegt.de\" target=\"_blank\"> cross-sectoral portal</a> brings together all the MSD prevention measures of the GDA bodies and social partners. It contains, for example, a database with details of more than 400 prevention measures categorised according to target groups.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Inspections and advice:</span> Since autumn 2014, labour inspectorates and the accident insurance institutions have been visiting companies, providing them with information and recommendations on how to maintain the health of their employees. The main focus of the inspections is on sectors and occupational groups that are particularly frequently affected by MSDs. By 2017 some 16,000 companies will have been visited.<br />Customised training and seminars: Training courses for managers and multipliers enable specialists from the work programme to pass on their expertise in MSD prevention.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Specialist events, exhibitions and congresses:</span> Such events offer people responsible for OSH in companies an opportunity to talk to experts about MSDs. The MSD portal offers information on events currently planned.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Prevention culture and health skills:</span> The work programme focuses on two approaches for effectively reducing MSDs: the development of a prevention culture in companies – i.e. the design of optimised workplaces; and health skills – i.e. the promotion of appropriate behaviour on the part of employees. The work programme helps to ensure that</p><ul><li>More companies are equipped with ergonomically optimised workplaces, workstations and work procedures,</li><li>More companies operate a system of workplace health management,</li><li>Work organisation and management competence in companies are improved with a view to preventing MSDs,</li><li>More and improved risk assessments for physical and mental stress are carried out,</li><li>The number of preventive health checks is increased where there are high levels of strain on the musculoskeletal system.</li></ul><p>At the same time, more employees should benefit from company-supported MSD prevention measures in order to improve their health skills.<br /><strong>Work Programme \"Psyche\" </strong><br />Internet portal gda-psyche.de: Here employers and employees find can find relevant information on the subject of psychological strains at work. For example, under the heading \"Work and Psyche from A to Z\", it explains the various factors affecting the well-being of employees and what companies can change.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Recommendations for implementing psychosocial risk assessment:</span> Since the end of 2013 the Safety and Health at Work Act explicitly calls for the consideration of psychological stress in risk assessments. In seven steps, a new brochure (see box on the right) explains the risk assessment of psychological strain, its methods and tools. Parameters are described within which the actual implementation of risk assessment is to move. The brochure is aimed particularly at companies and occupational safety actors (e.g. employers, works and staff councils, company physicians and specialists for occupational safety).<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Practical tools for the workplace:</span> The work programme collects examples of good practice for dealing with psychological stress in the workplace and makes them known to the public. Companies, workers and occupational safety and health experts receive practical support for the improvement of working conditions in everyday business.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Qualification of inspectors:</span> Inspectors from occupational health and safety authorities and accident insurance institutions are trained to identify mental stress and to adequately advise companies. By the end of 2017, the entire inspection staff will have a basic knowledge about psychological stress.<br /><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Inspections and advice:</span> Since the beginning of 2015, the inspection staff of the occupational safety and health authorities and accident insurers conducts coordinated inspections. The focus of the site inspections is the consideration of psychological stress in the risk assessment. The inspectors also advise businesses specifically on setting up working hours so as to promote health and on dealing with traumatic events in the workplace.<br /><strong> Activity Collaboration of institutions </strong><br />The German strategy addresses with all its core elements the collaboration of institutions (work programmes, cooperation on inspection activities, development of a coherent set of rules).<br />Federal states and public accident insurance institutions hand in hand: the Joint German Occupational Safety and Health Strategy (GDA) provides the framework. As part of the GDA, state occupational safety and health authorities and public accident insurance institutions have undertaken to adopt a work-sharing and coordinated approach in advising and supervising companies.<br />This approach aims at coordination, standardisation and transparency in consultancy.<br />Key tools of the joint consultancy and supervisory strategy are:</p><ul><li>Framework agreements on the interaction of the state occupational safety and health authorities and the public accident insurance institutions</li><li>Joint guidelines for coordinated, tactical supervisory action and equivalent implementation of occupational safety and health regulations</li><li>Promotion of data and information exchange between the federal states and the public accident insurance institutions on company inspections.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, the \"Occupational Safety and Health Forum\" was established under the German Strategy. Its task is to ensure early and active participation of the expert representatives of the umbrella organisations of the employers and workers, the professional and industrial associations, science, the health and pension insurance funds, institutions in the sector of safety and health at work as well as bodies which help to promote employability in the development and updating of the Joint German OSH Strategy.<br /><strong> Activity Optimisation of rules and regulations</strong><br />Statutory regulations are the basis for implementing and evaluating occupational safety and health measures.<br />One important requirement for the effective implementation of occupational safety and health regulations is that they are practicable, consistent and, above all, easily manageable by the users and self-explanatory. The German government, federal states and public accident insurance institutions set themselves the task under the Joint German Occupational Safety and Health Strategy of optimising the rules and regulations relating to safety and health at work. One important module is the guideline paper on the restructuring of the set of rules and regulations in occupational safety and health passed in August 2011. The guideline paper defines the relationship of state law to autonomous law of the public accident insurance institutions and describes the procedures with which the two areas of law are harmonised.<br /><strong>Activity Improvement of the cooperation and coordination of the actions of the public occupational safety and health authorities and accident insurance funds </strong><br />The occupational safety and health authorities and accident insurance institutions have undertaken to adopt a work-sharing and coordinated approach in advising and supervising companies. This approach aims at coordination, standardisation and transparency in consultancy. Activities are carried out accordingly to a <a href=\": http://www.gda-portal.de/en/SupportCompanies/SupportCompanies.html\" target=\"_blank\">programmatic approach</a>:<br />Key tools of the joint consultancy and supervisory strategy are:</p><ul><li>Framework agreements on the interaction of the state occupational safety and health authorities and the public accident insurance institutions</li><li>Joint guidelines for coordinated, tactical supervisory action and equivalent implementation of occupational safety and health regulations</li><li>Promotion of data and information exchange between the federal states and the public accident insurance institutions on company inspections</li></ul>",

  "L20217":"<p><strong>Priority 1: Improving the publicity, promotion and culture of prevention in the area of OSHP </strong><br />Care for OSHP by employers is regarded as ‘frequently minimal and formal’. <br />The objective is the enhancement of the awareness of the experts and lay public regarding OSHP, as part of the efforts to strengthen the prevention culture. <br />Improving OSHP publicity and promotion, not only through the bodies of labour inspection and supervision over the OSHP, but particularly through professional preventative services, employers’ representatives and professional employee associations and the academic community, research, the media and inside the employer through senior staff. <br /><strong>Priority 2: Improving the personal and material conditions for quality and effective operations of labour inspection bodies and other supervision bodies in the area of OSHP </strong><br />Pursuant to the International Labour Organization (ILO) and the Senior Labour Inspectors Committee (SLIC), conditions must be improved to promote effectively legal and other requirements for ensuring healthy and safe conditions at workplaces. That requires a sufficient quantity and quality of labour inspectors and other employees of bodies supervising OSHP. Language skills, English in particular, are also necessary<br />The performance of labour inspections and state supervision over OSHP must be intensified and its quality must be improved to the level of standards achieved in the EU Member States<br />The effective use of existing financial, technical and personnel resources of the state inspection bodies and supervisory organs should be achieved by better coordination and the gradual creation of conditions for the suitable institutional integration of present inspection and supervisory organs. <br /><strong>Priority 3: Improving the quality of activities of specialized subjects eligible to perform activities in the area of OSHP </strong><br />According to legal requirements, small and medium-sized organizations which do not have their own experts in the area of OSHP are obliged to fulfil certain obligations in the area of OSHP; these tasks are frequently ensured through outsourced/supply companies which are authorized to perform activities related to preventative and protective services (safety technical service, occupational health service). <br />As a result, labour inspectorates and public health authorities must intensively verify the quality of services and carry out controls in these companies focused on the professional qualifications of their employees and the quality and professional standards of their methods. <br /><strong> Priority 4: Applying system approach to OSHP-related issues </strong><br />Fulfilling the obligations in the area of OSHP is often insufficient, especially among small and medium-size employers and the level of legal awareness is low. It has been demonstrated that the application of a system approach to OSHP and its verification by an independent third party will increase the level of OSHP among individual subjects. In addition to the OSHP management system pursuant to the OHSAS 18 001 standard, the level of protection of employees in organizations in Slovakia can be verified through the Safe Enterprise project implemented by the National Labour Inspectorate (hereinafter referred to as the “NLI”). <br /><strong>Priority 5: The Focus of attention on sectors with a high number of occupational accidents and diseases </strong><br />Prevention, monitoring, punitive and repressive activities of the labour inspection and other state OSH institutions will focus on sectors and jobs with a higher incidence of health damage.</p>",

There needs to be much broader ownership of the issues. This means engaging everyone who shares the responsibility for helping Great Britain work well, because they have a vital role in managing risk and preventing damage to individuals, businesses and the economy. <br />Across each nation, region or sector, we need collective ownership that best reflects local circumstances. The regulators will retain their key roles, providing targeted advice and guidance for key audience groups and taking enforcement action when and where necessary. Encouraging others to take ownership of health and safety will be critical in making this theme successful. This means everyone collaborating to reach those who may have been less engaged”. <br /><strong>Strategic theme 2: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/tackling-ill-health.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tackling ill health</a>: Highlighting and tackling the costs of work-related ill health </strong> <br />Quote: <br />“Work-related ill health is a problem for every section of society, with conditions ranging from cancer and other long-latency diseases, to stress and musculo-skeletal disorders. Greater awareness of the harm, costs and preventability of work-related ill health should drive collective action to improve health outcomes. <br />This will require long-term and coordinated action across all sectors, bringing in additional partners such as the NHS and others to support the substantial behaviour change and awareness programmes that will be required. A key element of this theme will be in earlier prevention, which is more cost-effective than trying to intervene when a person is suffering from more serious ill health. This will involve a greater focus on health issues at work, while continuing to ensure that maintaining standards around safety remains a priority”. <br /><strong> Strategic theme 3: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/managing-risk-well.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Managing risk well</a>: Simplifying risk management and helping business to grow </strong><br />Quote:<br />“Successful organisations understand that sensible and proportionate risk management is integral to delivering their business. This approach supports growth, enables innovation and protects an organisation’s most vital asset, its people. Positive outcomes can include reduced sickness absence, lower costs and a good reputation. Promoting this compelling business case should help even more businesses to make the most of the many benefits a good health and safety culture can bring. Sharing examples of practice, supported by targeted, relevant advice and information will allow the system to set a common understanding of what proportionate health and safety looks like. Health and safety professionals have an important role to play. Helping businesses of all sizes get it right in an efficient and effective way will build trust and improve standards”. <br /><strong> Strategic theme 4: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/supporting-small-employers.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Supporting small employers:</a> Giving SMEs simple advice so they know what they have to do </strong><br />Quote:<br />Reaching micro and small businesses can be difficult, but not impossible. Working together, much has already been done to help small businesses, but there are opportunities to work smarter. Already many large businesses and intermediaries have developed efficient supply chains and productive relationships by working with and supporting small businesses. Many organisations also provide free help and support to SMEs outside their supply chains through cross-sector initiatives. <br />For SMEs, managing workplace risks shouldn’t be complicated or costly. Making support available which is quick and easy for small businesses to understand, so that they can fulfil their obligations, remains a challenge for all sectors. It will also be important to identify who the key influencers are for SMEs, working with them to raise awareness levels about the peer and expert support that is out there”. <br /><strong> Strategic theme 5: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/keeping-pace-with-change.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Keeping pace with change</a>: Anticipating and tackling new health and safety challenges </strong><br />Quote: <br />“Great Britain leads the world in anticipating and tackling the new health and safety challenges that come with social, economic and technological change. <br />This ability to horizon scan, when combined with the deep knowledge and unrivalled expertise of the system, means that anticipating new health and safety challenges is an area where Great Britain can play a leading role, for example through HSE’s world-leading research capabilities. They are already being put to use helping Great Britain, as well as countries around the world, to improve health and safety, as well as better business outcomes. <br />To remain a world leader in risk management, Great Britain needs to develop high-quality capability, anticipating the workplace challenges of tomorrow and using the flexibility of our goal-setting approach to solve them in ways that enable innovation and the use of new technologies. <br />Tackling the problems of tomorrow today is a responsible investment that protects workers, enables new and different approaches and provides the new knowledge, skills and expertise Great Britain can share internationally.” <br /><strong> Strategic theme 6: <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/strategy/sharing-our-success.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Sharing our success</a>: Promoting the benefits of Great Britain’s world-class health and safety system </strong><br />Quote: <br />“Everyone can take pride in Great Britain’s world-class reputation for health and safety and promote its success at home and abroad. Creating a world-class system is a goal we can all unite around and benefit from as a source of inspiration and achievement, and can also be pleased to support. <br />This strategy has largely concerned itself with improving standards in Great Britain. But we should also look to share best practice and the latest thinking and innovation around the world. This can help influence health and safety systems overseas and make it easier for British businesses to expand into new markets and territories. The work can also bring commercial opportunities for selling British health and safety ‘products’ or consultancy.</p>",

  "L20537":"Successfully reaching SMEs is and continues to be a weak point. Implementation is good when there are large in-house preventive services; in SMEs, however, risk assessment poses problems and the number of visits by external services to SMEs is unsatisfactory. ‘Emerging risks’ such as psychosocial stress and MSDs are increasing in all enterprises and are not being adequately countered by the Directives.",
  "L20538":"Good organisation of OSH management has been ensured in most large and medium-sized enterprises. The micro and small enterprises and a percentage of the medium-sized ones are experiencing difficulties in this respect, due to the fact that they have no established traditions, that the employers do not possess sufficient managerial experience and that they are not well informed about the labour legislation and the requirements for safety and health at work.",
  "L20539":"The practical difficulties encountered in ensuring that the directives achieve their aims relate to the inability of small businesses to comply with the requirements of the directives, due to the lack of know-how, equipment, appropriate means, suitably qualified staff, and capital. In addition, small businesses fail to provide sufficient documentation of the measures taken to ensure the compliance of employers with the relevant legislation. One example is the lack of appropriate risk assessment reporting and the absence of equipment maintenance documents, accident records and personnel training.",
  "L20540":"The information available indicates that small and medium-sized enterprises have no difficulties in meeting the requirements set out in applicable legislation stemming from the relevant Directives. Any difficulties that small and medium- sized enterprises do face have no basis in the Directives, as these lay down only minimum standards.",
  "L20541":"The federal state supervisory authorities found that Directives with insufficiently detailed targets cause problems for SMEs. As the OSH Directives allow latitude for interpretation, the type and scope of precautions caused difficult discussions in  some  cases.  Employers  often  ask  if  and  when  and  to  what  extent  the provisions of the Directives are binding in other EU Member States. Often SMEs have no overview of the transposition of the OSH Directives into national law, in terms of scope, complexity and application in selected areas. Often SMEs do not have well-trained OSH officers. There is little acceptance of the cost and time needed to implement OSH provisions. Compared with large companies and groups, SMEs generally have to pay handsomely for advice from experienced OSH experts. This makes it difficult and costly for SMEs to implement OSH standards. The DGB also complains of inadequate implementation of OSH obligations in SMEs, which it ascribes in part to inadequate specification in OSH rules or to inadequate supervision by the competent authorities.",
  "L20542":"In the course of its inspection work, the Danish Working Environment Authority has become aware that it can be difficult for small undertakings to have the necessary working-environment expertise themselves.",
  "L20543":"The problems are firstly related to the scarcity of financial possibilities for investing in the working environment, understanding of the need for the compliance with the requirements, lack of the required knowledge as well as high market prices of mandatory services (training courses for working environment representatives and first aid providers, medical examinations of workers, etc.) provided to the employer.",
  "L20544":"The main difficulty faced by SMEs in following the Directive’s requirements is the lack of financial and human resources.",
  "L20545":"However, the negative aspects of the new framework’s introduction included the fact that the speed with which the Community legislation on health and safety at work was transposed into Spanish law, as well as the multitude and complexity of legislation on occupational risk prevention, make compliance difficult, particularly For small and medium-sized enterprises.",
  "L20546":"Note: While Finland does not answer the question in the general section 1, the answer 'no' has been provided for the Framework Directive and all other OSH Directives (with one note for the Medical treatment on board vessels Directive.",
  "L20547":"Microenterprises and SMEs encounter difficulties when they try to meet their occupational-risk prevention obligations, chiefly for want of human, technical and financial resources, for want of information or, conversely, because they are bombarded with too much fragmented information.",
  "L20548":"A lot of SMEs, however, have cut back on their health and safety expenditure (laying off health and safety experts, cancelling service contracts, failure to carry out instrumental occupational hygiene tests of the work environment or the examination of the biological exposure/impact indicators, deficiencies of the supply of personal protective equipment and information etc.), which poses direct risks to the health and safety of workers.",
  "L20549":"A frustration among many small firms is that there appears to be little synergy between the current implementation of directives. There also appears to be little or no regard for the small business environment, where little or no account is taken for the additional administrative and compliance burden that is placed on them relative to larger organisations.",
  "L20550":"Note: Question not included",
  "L20551":"Note:  No clear response is provided, but for most individual Directives the answer is 'no'.",
  "L20552":"Luxembourg has no information on any particular difficulties encountered by SMEs.",
  "L20553":"Information on the potential difficulties of SMEs in following the requirements of specific directives is not available in Latvia; however, according to the survey of work conditions and risks in Latvia all work safety measures are implemented by micro enterprises less often than the country average.",
  "L20554":"Studies have shown that contrary to small enterprises, large companies are generally better equipped to have and develop safe work practices",
  "L20555":"Compliance in SMEs is lagging behind for each of the obligations. It also appears here that the degree of compliance is linked to the size of the undertaking.",
  "L20556":"Difficulties in following the requirements of Directives regarding health and safety of workers in SMEs are linked primarily with a lack of sufficient financial resources for the performance of obligations in respect of health and safety at work. Furthermore, in accordance with applicable provisions, employers who employ up to 100 workers are not obliged to create a health and safety at work service. (They can entrust the performance of health and safety at work tasks to a staff member already carrying out another job, or - in the event of absence of competent workers - to external specialists). As a result, at such employers premises some duties in the field of health and safety at work are not performed or their performance is not satisfactory.",
  "L20557":"Yes. In general, small and micro-enterprises which represent about 90 % of companies in Portugal, do not, as a rule, have sufficient technical skills in the areas of health and safety at work, in the absence of a recognised culture of risk prevention.",
  "L20558":"The main difficulties for SMEs are financial: insufficient funds to replace and modernise all work equipment, high cost of modern work equipment for handling load, and insufficient financial resources to conduct the medical examinations provided for in the Directive, etc.",
  "L20559":"During the investigations that have been carried out, small undertakings have, among other things, reported a lack of time for work environment management and a perception of the regulations as being complicated. The Swedish Work 22 (31) Environment Authority has found, through its inspections, some major shortcomings in knowledge of work environment management among small and medium-sized enterprises.",
  "L20560":"Substantive reasons for these problems, besides the current economic crisis, include the following factors: - they lack funding and do not have resources set aside to keep equipment in a safe and working condition, or to verify the safety of work equipment or other facilities used; - they do not employ their own occupational safety and health specialists, instead hiring external technical safety services; - it is up to them to choose a quality business authorised to provide safety technical services (they do not always select a quality outfit).",
  "L20561":"Note: Comment is from q2.8: We can summarise, from the annual reports on the work of the Labour Inspectorate, that employers are too frequently unaware of the importance of ensuring health and safety at work; this applies in particular to those employers who entrust all health and safety at work tasks to outside contractors. When they sign contracts with an outside contractor, employers often seem to believe that they have done everything required to ensure health and safety at work.",
  "L20562":"Allocating sufficient time and resources to document the risk assessment, particularly where various activities are involved or they are complex or technical in nature.

The registered fatal accident of each member state are multiplied with this ratio, i.e. with 1,098. The result is an estimated figure that is in many cases much higher than the registered number of non-fatal accidents.

  "L22540":"<p>The occupational safety and health national infrastructure is structured and influenced by the OHSA. The main aims and objectives of the Occupational Health and Safety Authority include raising awareness of health and safety as an issue in the workplace, providing information and promoting training on health and safety matters as well as consulting widely and effectively on health and safety regulations and guidance. The OHSA is responsible for the ensuring that the physical, psychological and social well-being of all Maltese workers in all workplaces is promoted; and, in turn, to ensure that workers health and safety is actively safeguarded, by whoever is obliged to do so, by ensuring that the levels of occupational health and safety protection (as established by the Act and by the regulations made under this Act) are maintained. Since Malta’s accession to the European Union, the OHS Authority has continued the exercise of harmonization of all new occupational health and safety legislation with EU OHS Directives, while at the same time reviewing existing legislation to ensure that there are no regulatory gaps, and to identify any conflicting or burdensome legislation, with the scope of simplifying it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Among its various fuctions, the OHSA:</p><ol><li>applies the provisions of the Act and any regulations or orders made there under;</li><li>establishes strategies by which the general national policy relating to occupational health and safety may be implemented;</li><li>advises the Minister regarding the making of regulations;</li><li>monitors compliance with the relevant health and safety legislation;</li><li>prepares regulations and codes of practice;</li><li>promotes the dissemination of information, education and training;</li><li>collates and analyses data and statistics;</li><li>keeps registers of plants, installations, equipment, machinery, articles, substances or chemicals in use at work;</li><li>carries out investigations on any matter concerning occupational health and safety;</li><li>promotes and carries out scientific research; and</li><li>keeps registers of persons competent to give advice on matters related to OHS.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As aforementiond, the OHSA is the national statutory body with responsibility for enforcing ocupational safety and health law, promoting and encouraging accident prevention, and providing infomation and advice to companies, organisations and individuals.

Through the enactment of the Act (Act XXVII of 2000), a number of health and safety officers were appointed by the OHSA. These officers are deemed to be Public Officers under Criminal Code, and, thus, are protected by law whilst on duty. These inspection officers have a number of powers at law, including: to enter freely into any workplace (day or night) without any pervious notice; and to inspect any document the keeping of which which is prescribed by any OSH regulation; and to issue order to any person to preserve OHS.</p>",

  "L22714":"In a case of sickness (not related to work) the first day is a waiting period when no compensation is paid. The employer pays sick pay compensation during days 2-14 of the sickness to the amount of 80% of the employee's salary. After the sick pay period, sickness benefit to the amount of 80% of the work income is paid by the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (Försäkringskassan) which administers social insurance in Sweden. A sickness benefit can be granted for a maximum of 364 days during a 15 month period. Extended sickness benefit can be obtained for at most 550 days. The amount of the extended sickness benefit is 75% of the work income. If the sickness lasts for more than seven days, a doctor’s certificate is required. In certain cases the employer or the Swedish social insurance agency may require a doctor’s certificate from the first day of the illness. A doctor’s certificate should include the description about how the illness affects the work capacity and the estimate of the length of the illness. If the work ability is permanently reduced for at least a one quarter, the Swedish Social Insurance Agency may replace the sickness benefit with sickness or activity compensation. The amount of full income-related sickness compensation is 64% of the assumed income.\r\nAccording to the Swedish Work Environment Act the employers are responsible for organized work rehabilitation and must make a rehabilitation investigation when an employee has been sick-listed for more than 4 weeks. The employer arranges a rehabilitation investigation in collaboration with the Swedish Social Insurance Agency (Försäkringskassan).\r\nThe employer must notify the Social Insurance Agency about injuries at work. If the injury is severe or someone has died at work, the employer has to report to the Swedish Work Environment Authority, SWEA immediately.

Supervision is exercised by different inspection activities, the main ones being general, target or follow-up inspection.

A more specific sector is focused in the case of an enterprise with one or different fields of activity. A target inspection visit can also be motivated by information submitted to the Labour Inspectorate on non-compliance with occupational health and safety requirements, diagnosing work-related diseases, occurrence of an accident at work or hazardous work. In the course of a follow-up inspection, elimination of earlier detected infringements is monitored at the enterprise. In the course of inspection of a new or reconstructed building, the conformity of work environment with the requirements of health and safety at work is monitored. Such inspections are carried out at the request of a local government and in cases when the employer has notified the Labour Inspectorate of the commencement of activities or change of the field of activity. One of the responsibilities of the Labour Inspectorate is to carry out market supervision of personal protective equipment to be supplied. During the inspection, the compliance of personal protective equipment with requirements is checked with the aim of preventing placing on the market and taking into use of unsuitable personal protective equipment. The Occupational Health and Safety Act provides labour inspectors with several rights for carrying out supervision, including the right to enter the work place to be inspected with the aim of performing inspection activity (if necessary, also unannounced), receive information necessary for inspection, examine relevant documents, receive copies of them free of charge or have them made on the spot, and in the case of suspicion of misdemeanour, take along documents, require audit measurements of the working environment, take pictures and samples of materials and substances to be analysed, interview the employer, work environment representative, work environment specialist and workers alone or in the presence of witnesses and issue a notice with the purpose of terminating the infringement of requirements of legal acts and eliminating the consequences of the infringements.</p><p>The Labour Inspectorate together with other state authorities – Health Board, National Institute for Health Development, Rescue Board, Consumer Protection Inspectorate, Technical Regulatory Authority, Road Administration, Tax and Customs Board – form a national structure protecting good health of the population of Estonia.

In this case, although there is a need to carry out their duties, SLI inspectors cannot enter the premises without the consent of the owners of premises. A similar situation also arises in ships flying with the flag of a foreign country, but located in the territory of the Republic of Lithuania. In this case, for instance when investigating the accident, which took place on board, the SLI inspectors require the consent of the ship's captain to access to ship.</p><p>Another difficulty for the SLI inspectors in exercising their duties is the reluctance of people (witnesses, victims and so on) to cooperate.
